# Challenge


The goal of the challenge was to retrieve the flag from applications of operations mod 67.
Here is the source code of the challenge.

```python
characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789{}~_"
flag = "lactf{REDACTED~}"

def bigram_multiplicative_shift(bigram):
    assert(len(bigram) == 2)
    pos1 = characters.find(bigram[0]) + 1
    pos2 = characters.find(bigram[1]) + 1
    shift = (pos1 * pos2) % 67
    return characters[((pos1 * shift) % 67) - 1] + characters[((pos2 * shift) % 67) - 1]

shifted_flag = ""
for i in range(0, len(flag), 2):
    bigram = flag[i:i+2]
    shifted_bigram = bigram_multiplicative_shift(bigram)
    shifted_flag += shifted_bigram
print(shifted_flag)
# jlT84CKOAhxvdrPQWlWT6cEVD78z5QREBINSsU50FMhv662W
# Get solving!
# ...it's not injective you say? Ok fine, I'll give you a hint.
not_the_flag = "mCtRNrPw_Ay9mytTR7ZpLJtrflqLS0BLpthi~2LgUY9cii7w"
also_not_the_flag = "PKRcu0l}D823P2R8c~H9DMc{NmxDF{hD3cB~i1Db}kpR77iU"
```

# Solution

The letters were encrypted by blocks of 2.
To decrypt a block of 2 letters, the following could be done:
1. From the values of ```pos1*shift=pos1^2 . pos2``` and ```pos2.shift = pos1.pos2^2``` mod 67, we can retrieve the values of ```pos1^3``` and ```pos2^3```.
2. From the values of ```pos1^3``` and ```pos2^3``` mod 67, compute the three different possible values for pos1 and pos2.
3. Use the two "not the flag" strings to eliminate two values each time, the remaining one is the one from the flag.
